GOAL:
--------------------

The Brogrammers are attempting to create a Pac-Man-type game, with a mix of a Mario Party "3 vs 1" minigame.  
The game contains 4 players, 1 player is the "Pac-Man" and runs around and gets points.   
The other three players must actively try to apprehend the "Pac-Man" and chase him around the screen.  
The point of the game is for the "Pac-Man" to survive for as long as possible.

Sub-Goals:
--------------------

-The ghosts/apprehenders are slower than the main player.  
-Four-player functionality with keys on one keyboard.  
-Avatar/player-selection in game.  
-Highscore system  
-Power-ups

Lee Sport's face is going to represent Pac-Man.

The name of the game will be **Lee Sport vs. The World**
